# Native-struct serialization parity

Work in progress on `jairus/serialize-parity`. The target is near parity with
simdjson's fresh owning-struct serialization across the classic corpus. The
initial three-corpus screen is not whole-corpus qualification.

## Initial baseline

Measured on local ARM64, on AC power, with the shared host timing lock.
Runtime/host versions, binary and source hashes, power state, process audits,
and every sample are in the [raw capture](data/serialize-parity-baseline-6a37efd7.json.gz).
The json-as implementation is main at `6a37efd7`; the only code change for this
capture is the serialization phase added to the paired comparison runner.

| Corpus | json-as µs | simdjson µs | json-as GB/s | simdjson GB/s | Throughput ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Twitter | 134.67 | 45.59 | 3.55 | 10.47 | 0.34× |
| Canada | 2541.57 | 1706.70 | 0.82 | 1.22 | 0.67× |
| CITM | 264.75 | 49.34 | 1.89 | 10.14 | 0.19× |

Numbers are medians of five alternating fresh-process pairs, SIMD json-as with
the incremental runtime, compatibility mode, validation disabled, and fast
readers enabled. Both writers serialize complete owned models to fresh strings
on every operation; the simdjson adapter does not cache serialized output.
The original classic AS harness, including its warmup and allocation behavior,
is retained. This is warmed-code serialization of an existing object, not
latency of the first call in a fresh module. GB/s uses each writer's actual
UTF-8 output length; json-as internally produces UTF-16 strings.

Before timing, complete model outputs were checked against integer-preserving
oracles, including retained models serialized after input disposal and GC.
Native output is also checked after every process invocation. Preparation seals
sources, runtime files and binaries; measurement rejects changed seals.

The 90% gate failed on all three initial corpora. CITM is the first profiling
target. Runtime optimization, paired before/after qualification, remaining
classic coverage, and a final performance verdict are outstanding.
